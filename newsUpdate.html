            <p><strong><center>AMU News</center></strong></p>
            <p>A recent statement from the U.N. Security Council highlighted internal divisions regarding criticism of the Taliban’s new “Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice” law. While some members, including the U.S. and allies, advocate for continued pressure on the Taliban to adhere to international standards, China and Russia argue for non-interference, preferring dialogue without additional pressure. The U.N. plans a meeting on Afghanistan on September 18 to discuss the situation further.</p>

            <p><strong><center>Reliefweb</center></strong></p>
            <p>In the 4th week of August 2024, Afghanistan experienced minor price fluctuations in key food items, with sugar and tomatoes decreasing by 3.2% and 3.0%, respectively, while onions rose by 4.2%. Overall, prices are trending down compared to last year, except for salt and onions, which increased by 9% and 21%. This trend is driven by the appreciation of the Afghani and global deflation. Non-food items also showed slight changes, with fertilizer prices dropping as the harvest season ends.</p>

            <p>The United Nations remains committed to engaging in Afghanistan despite the Taliban’s new restrictive morality law, which imposes severe limitations on women’s public activities, appearance, and movement. This law, enacted on August 21, has drawn widespread condemnation from the UN and human rights organizations, who view it as a significant setback for women’s rights. The Taliban defends the law as aligned with their interpretation of Sharia law.</p>
